<p>You are Thanos and you want the Infinity Stones!</p>
            <p>
              There are six Infinity Stones. By clicking on a stone, you will
              add a specific amount of points to your total score.
            </p>
            <p>
              You win the game by matching your total score to the random number
              assigned to you at the start of each game. If your total score
              goes above the random number, you lose!
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it as a galactic game of Blackjack. One where exactly
              half of humanity hangs in the balance. No pressure!
